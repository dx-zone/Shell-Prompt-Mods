# Shell-Prompt-Mods
This is a collection of scripts to modernize, colorize, and customized your shell prompt (BASH or ZSH) terminal

The oh-my-zsh-activate script, is a script to check for Oh My Zsh installation (a modern colorized prompt and framework to manage zsh configurations), and switch to the Z shell (zsh) if found, if not, it will install it and activate the Oh My Sh framework for my terminal prompt. I found myself switching between colorized themes and other shells for testing, such as bash (switching from bash to zsh back and forth). So the script allows me to switch back to Oh My Sh which in turn will activate the colorized prompt and zsh setting I like from the Oh My Sh framework.
